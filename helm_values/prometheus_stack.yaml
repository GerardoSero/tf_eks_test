  prometheusSpec:

    ## Number of replicas of each shard to deploy for a Prometheus deployment.
    ## Number of replicas multiplied by shards is the total number of Pods created.
    ##
    replicas: 2

    ## Pod anti-affinity can prevent the scheduler from placing Prometheus replicas on the same node.
    ## The default value "soft" means that the scheduler should *prefer* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node but no guarantee is provided.
    ## The value "hard" means that the scheduler is *required* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node.
    ## The value "" will disable pod anti-affinity so that no anti-affinity rules will be configured.

    ## AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations
    ## are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations must have the form
    ## as specified in the official Prometheus documentation:
    ## https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are
    ## appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility
    ## to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible
    ## scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.
    ##
    ## The scrape configuration example below will find master nodes, provided they have the name .*mst.*, relabel the
    ## port to 2379 and allow etcd scraping provided it is running on all Kubernetes master nodes
